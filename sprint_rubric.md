# Sprint Rubric

Receive bonus points for pushing a non-troll commit to your project every day for at least a week.

- 7 days = 1 pt
- 10 days = 2 pts
- 14 days = 3 pts
- Waiting on me for more than 24 hrs? +1 point

A good way to make this happen is to create another branch of your project called `development` or `experimental` or `foo` and try things out in this branch*. You can code, commit, and push without changing your "official" project. You even have my permission to push broken code if necessary.

*Nothing's for free -- now you have to be clear about what branch you're working on at any given moment. This is why I type `git status` compulsively :)
