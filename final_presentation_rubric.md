- The presenter reads more than seven words in a row from any given slide (-1 point per slide)
- A slide contains more than 70 words (-1 point per slide)
- Only one version of the code is presented and demonstrated (-4 points)
- Only two versions of the code are presented and demonstrated (-2 points)
- The presentation is longer than 12 minutes* (-4 points)
